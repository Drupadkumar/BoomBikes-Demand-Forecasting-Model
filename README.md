# BoomBikes Bike Rental Demand Prediction
## Problem

BoomBikes, a leading bike-sharing service, faced a significant decline in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.
To support business recovery, the company needed to understand:

* What factors influence bike rental demand

* How demand is likely to behave in the near future

* Which variables can help optimize inventory and pricing decisions

The goal was to deliver insights and build a prediction model that helps the company plan effectively in a post-pandemic market.

## Solution

To address the problem, a complete data-driven analysis was performed:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Identified seasonal trends and customer behavior patterns

* Analyzed the impact of weather, temperature, holidays, working days, and environmental conditions

* Checked correlations and multicollinearity among variables

2. Machine Learning Model

* Built a predictive model using Linear Regression

* Applied feature engineering and variable selection techniques

* Split data into training and test sets to measure real-world performance

* Evaluated model using R², RMSE, and residual diagnostics

## Outcome

The project delivered:

* Accurate demand forecasts to guide operational planning

* Key factors influencing rentals, such as temperature, season, weather, humidity, and working days

* Insights to support strategic recovery decisions, including resource allocation and customer targeting

* A predictive model that can be used for future planning and revenue optimization

These insights empower BoomBikes to improve demand prediction accuracy and strengthen their post-pandemic growth strategy.
